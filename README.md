## 📘 Self-Study in Cybersecurity

Outside of my university program, I studied ethical hacking fundamentals using the book:

Daniel G. Graham — “Ethical Hacking: A Hands-on Introduction to Breaking In” (2022)

As part of my self-study, I:
- worked in isolated and virtual lab environments  
- practiced using Kali Linux  
- explored common vulnerabilities and attack vectors  
- focused on understanding how systems can be protected  

All activities were conducted strictly for educational and ethical purposes.
